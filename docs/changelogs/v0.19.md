### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Improving the libp2p resource management integration
There are further followups up on libp2p resource manager improvements in Kubo [0.18.0](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.18.md#improving-libp2p-resource-management-integration-1)
and [0.18.1](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.18.md#improving-libp2p-resource-management-integration):
1. `ipfs swarm limits` and `ipfs swarm stats` have been replaced by `ipfs swarm resources` to provide a single/combined view for limits and their current usage in a more intuitive ordering.  
1. Removal of `Swarm.ResourceMgr.Limits` config.  Instead [the power user can specify limits in a .json file that are fed directly to go-libp2p](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md#user-supplied-override-limits).  This allows the power user to take advantage of the [new resource manager types introduced in go-libp2p 0.25](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#new-resource-manager-types-) including "use default", "unlimited", "block all".
   - Note: we don't expect most users to need these capablities, but they are there if so.
1. [Doc updates](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md).  

#### PubSub message caching improvements

The PubSub message cache will now [prune messages after TTL is exhausted](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#pubsubseenmessagesttl), [either based on the last time a message was seen or the first time it was seen](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#pubsubseenmessagesstrategy).

#### Gateways

##### Signed IPNS Record response format

This release implements [IPIP-351](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/351) and
adds Gateway support for returning signed (verifiable) `ipns-record` (0x0300)
when `/ipns/{libp2p-key}` is requested with either
`Accept: application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record` HTTP header
or `?format=ipns-record` URL query parameter.


The Gateway in Kubo already supported [trustless, verifiable retrieval](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval) of immutable `/ipfs/` namespace.
With `?format=ipns-record`, light HTTP clients are now able to get the same level of verifiability for IPNS websites.

Tooling is limited at the moment, but we are working on [go-libipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/) examples that illustrate the verifiable HTTP client pattern.

##### Example: fetch IPNS record over HTTP and inspect it with `ipfs name inspect --verify`

```console
$ FILE_CID=$(echo "Hello IPFS" | ipfs add --cid-version 1 -q)
$ IPNS_KEY=$(ipfs key gen test)
$ ipfs name publish /ipfs/$FILE_CID --key=test --ttl=30m
Published to k51q..dvf1: /ipfs/bafk..z244
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipns/$IPNS_KEY?format=ipns-record" > signed.ipns-record
$ ipfs name inspect --verify $IPNS_KEY < signed.ipns-record
Value:         "/ipfs/bafk..."
Validity Type: "EOL"
Validity:      2023-03-09T23:13:34.032977468Z
Sequence:      0
TTL:           1800000000000
PublicKey:     ""
Signature V1:  "m..."
Signature V2:  "m..."
Data:          {...}

Validation results:
 Valid:     true
 PublicKey: 12D3...
```

#### Addition of "autoclient" router type
A new routing type "autoclient" has been added. This mode is similar to "auto", in that it is a hybrid of content routers (including Kademlia and HTTP routers), but it does not run a DHT server. This is similar to the difference between "dhtclient" and "dht" router types.

See the [Routing.Type documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#routingtype) for more information.

#### Deprecation of the `ipfs pubsub` commands and matching HTTP endpoints

We are deprecating `ipfs pubsub` and all `/api/v0/pubsub/` RPC endpoints and will remove them in the next release.

For more information and rational see [#9717](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9717).
