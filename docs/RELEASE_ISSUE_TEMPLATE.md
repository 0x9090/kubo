## ✅ Release Checklist

Checklist:

- [ ] **Stage 0 - Prerequisites**
  - [ ] Open an issue against [bifrost-infra](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra) ahead of the release ([example](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/issues/2109)).  **Idealy, do this multiple days in advance of the RC** to give Bifrost the heads up that asks will be coming their way.
    - [ ] Spell out all that we want updated - gateways, the bootstraper and the cluster/preload nodes
    - [ ] Mention @protocol/bifrost-team in the issue and let them know the expected date of the release
      - Issue link:

  - [ ] Bump the version in `version.go` in the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to `vX.Y.Z-rcN`.
        <details>
        # checkout new branch

        </details>
  - [ ] If applicable, add new commits to the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch from `master` using `git cherry-pick -x ...`
      - Note: `release-*` branches are protected. You can do all needed updates on a separated branch (e.g. `wip-release-vX.Y.Z`) and when everything is settled push to `release-vX.Y.Z`
  - [ ] Push the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to GitHub (`git push origin release-vX.Y.Z`) and create a draft PR targetting `release` branch if it doesn't exist yet ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9306)).

        </details>
  - [ ] Wait for CI to run and complete PR checks. All checks should pass.
  - [ ] Create a signed tag for the release candidate.
    - [ ] This is a dangerous operation, as it is difficult to reverse due to Go modules and automated Docker image publishing. Remember to verify the commands you intend to run for items marked with ⚠️ with the release reviewer.
    - [ ] ⚠️ Tag HEAD `release-vX.Y.Z` commit with `vX.Y.Z-rcN` (`git tag -s vX.Y.Z-rcN -m 'Pre-release X.Y.Z-rcn'`)
        <details>
        # create a signed tag
        git tag -s v0.17.0-rc1 -m 'Pre-release 0.17.0-rc1'
        </details>
    - [ ] Run `git show vX.Y.Z-rc1` to ensure the tag is correct.
        <details>
        # show the signed tag
        git show v0.17.0-rc1
        </details>
    - [ ] ⚠️ Push the `vX.Y.Z-rc1` tag to GitHub (`git push origin vX.Y.Z-rc1`; DO NOT USE `git push --tags` because it pushes all your local tags).
        <details>
        # show the signed tag
        git push origin v0.17.0-rc1
        </details>
  - [ ] Add artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.tech by making a PR against [ipfs/distributions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions)
    - [ ] Clone the `ipfs/distributions` repo locally.
    - [ ] Create a new branch (`kubo-release-vX.Y.Z-rcn`) from `master`.
        <details>
        # checkout new branch
        git checkout -b kubo-release-v0.17.0-rc1
        </details>
    - [ ] Run `./dist.sh add-version kubo vX.Y.Z-rcN` to add the new version to the `versions` file ([instructions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions#usage)).
      - `dist.sh` will print _WARNING: not marking pre-release kubo vX.Y.Z-rc1n as the current version._.
        <details>
        # add new kubo version to dist
        ./dist.sh add-version kubo v0.17.0-rc1
        </details>
    - [ ] Push the `kubo-release-vX.Y.Z-rcn` branch to GitHub and create a PR from that branch ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/pull/760)).
        <details>
        # push the change

          -f base='master'
        </details>
    - [ ] Ask for a review from the release reviewer.
    - [ ] Enable auto-merge for the PR.
      - PR build will build the artifacts and generate a diff in around 30 minutes
      - PR will be merged automatically once the diff is approved
      - `master` build will publish the artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.io in around 30 minutes

      - [ ] Check that the comunication between Kubo daemon and IPFS companion is working properly checking if the number of connected peers changes.
- [ ] **Stage 5 - Release** - _ONLY FOR FINAL RELEASE_
  - [ ] Prepare the `release` branch.
    - [ ] Bump the version in `version.go` in the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to `vX.Y.Z`.
    - [ ] Update the [docs/changelogs/vX.Y.md](docs/changelogs) with the new commits and contributors.
      - [ ] Run `./bin/mkreleaselog` twice to generate the changelog and copy the output.
      - The first run of the script might be poluted with `git clone` output.
      - [ ] Paste the output into the `### Changelog` section of the changelog file inside the `<details><summary></summary></details>` block.
      - [ ] Commit the changelog changes.
    - [ ] Push the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch to GitHub (`git push origin release-vX.Y.Z`)
    - [ ] Mark the PR created from `release-vX.Y.Z` as ready for review.
      - [ ] Ensure the PR is targetting `release` branch.
      - [ ] Ensure that CI is green.
      - [ ] Have release reviewer review the PR.
    - [ ] Merge the PR into `release` branch using the `Create a merge commit` (do **NOT** use `Squash and merge` nor `Rebase and merge` because we need to be able to sign the merge commit).
      - Do not delete the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch.
    - [ ] Checkout the `release` branch locally.
      - Remember to pull the latest changes.
    - [ ] Create a signed tag for the release.
      - [ ] This is a dangerous operation, as it is difficult to reverse due to Go modules and automated Docker image publishing. Remember to verify the commands you intend to run for items marked with ⚠️ with the release reviewer.
      - [ ] ⚠️ Tag HEAD `release` commit with `vX.Y.Z` (`git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m 'Release X.Y.Z'`)
      - [ ] Run `git show vX.Y.Z` to ensure the tag is correct.
      - [ ] ⚠️ Push the `vX.Y.Z` tag to GitHub (`git push origin vX.Y.Z`; DO NOT USE `git push --tags` because it pushes all your local tags).
  - [ ] Publish the release.
    - [ ] Wait for [Publish docker image](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml) workflow run initiated by the tag push to finish.
    - [ ] Add artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.tech by making a PR against [ipfs/distributions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions)
      - [ ] Clone the `ipfs/distributions` repo locally.
      - [ ] Create a new branch (`kubo-release-vX.Y.Z`) from `master`.
      - [ ] Run `./dist.sh add-version kubo vX.Y.Z` to add the new version to the `versions` file ([instructions](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions#usage)).
      - [ ] Push the `kubo-release-vX.Y.Z` branch to GitHub and create a PR from that branch ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/pull/768)).
      - [ ] Ask for a review from the release reviewer.
      - [ ] Enable auto-merge for the PR.
        - PR build will build the artifacts and generate a diff in around 30 minutes
        - PR will be merged automatically once the diff is approved
        - `master` build will publish the artifacts to https://dist.ipfs.io in around 30 minutes
      - [ ] Ensure that the artifacts are available at https://dist.ipfs.io
    - [ ] Publish the release to [the NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/go-ipfs?activeTab=versions) by running https://github.com/ipfs/npm-go-ipfs/actions/workflows/main.yml (it happens automatically but it is safe to speed up the process and kick of a run manually)
  - [ ] Cut the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases) ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release), [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.16.0))
    - Use `vX.Y.Z` as the tag.
    - Link to the release issue in the description.
    - Copy the relevant [changelog](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/release/docs/changelogs/) into the release description.
      - Keep the release notes as trim as possible (e.g. remove top headers where possible, [example](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.15.0))
  - [ ] Synchronize release artifacts by running [sync-release-assets](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/actions/workflows/sync-release-assets.yml) workflow.
  - [ ] Announce the release
    - [ ] Add a link to the release to this release issue as a comment.
    - [ ] Create a new post on [IPFS Discourse](https://discuss.ipfs.tech). ([example](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/kubo-v0-16-0-release-is-out/15286))
      - Use `Kubo vX.Y.Z Release is out!` as the title.
      - Use `kubo` and `go-ipfs` as topics.
      - Repeat the title as a heading (`##`) in the description.
      - Link to the GitHub Release, binaries on IPNS, docker pull command and release notes in the description.
    - [ ] Pin the topic globally so that it stays at the top of the category.
    - [ ] If there is no more important banner currently set on Discourse (e.g. IPFS Camp announcement), make the topic into a banner.
    - [ ] Check if Discourse post was automatically copied to:
      - [ ] IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter
      - [ ] FIL Slack #ipfs-chatter
      - [ ] Matrix
  - [ ] Add a link from release notes to Discuss post (like we did here: https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.15.0)
  - [ ] Update the draft PR created for [interop](https://github.com/ipfs/interop) to use the new release and mark it as ready for review.
  - [ ] Update the draft PR created for [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) to use the new release and mark it as ready for review.
  - [ ] Update docs
    - [ ] Run https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/actions/workflows/update-on-new-ipfs-tag.yml to generate a PR to the docs repo
    - [ ] Merge the auto-created PR in https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/pulls ([example](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/pull/1263))
  - [ ] Get the blog post created and shared
    - [ ] Submit a request for blog post creation using [the form](https://airtable.com/shrNH8YWole1xc70I).
      - Notify marketing in #shared-pl-marketing-requests about the blog entry request (since the form tends to go to spam; [example]([example](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C018EJ8LWH1/p1664885305374909))).
      - Don't mark this as done until the blog entry is live.
    - [ ] Share the blog post
      - [ ] Twitter (request in Filecoin Slack channel #shared-pl-marketing-requests; [example](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C018EJ8LWH1/p1664903524843269?thread_ts=1664885305.374909&cid=C018EJ8LWH1))
      - [ ] [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ipfs)
- [ ] **Stage 6 - Post-Release**
  - [ ] Merge the `release` branch back into `master`, ignoring the changes to `version.go` (keep the `-dev` version from master).
  - [ ] Create an issue using this release issue template for the _next_ release.
  - [ ] Close this release issue.
